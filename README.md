3D Scene - CS 330




How do I approach designing software?  I usally approach projects and sit and think where to start and list the topics I feel like I need to do research on before I start the project. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? I learned how to implement a camera within my code and give it controls so that the users can navigate my design.
What design process did you follow for your project work? I followed all the templetates that the instructor provided and was able to key in my own numbers like camer position.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? In future work I will be able to create designs faster because I know have the skills needed.
How do I approach developing programs? I always approach it writting down things that I know I will need to study in order to develop this program. 
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I learned how important it was to be able to plot points correctly so that the program can make the correct shapes for me. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? Every milestone I completed gave me further reach into the main project.
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? I plan to be a software engineer on a very large team and also be able to develop my own projects.
